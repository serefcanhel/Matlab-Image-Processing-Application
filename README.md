# Matlab-Image-Processing-Application

  ==> This application is designed to simulate different image process algorithms.
  
  ==> This application is made to understand the logic behind image processing algorithms.
  
  ==> All algorithms are written in built-in function. There is not any MATLAB functions are used in this application.
  
# Algorithms 

  ==> Each algorithms are implemented in the different tabs in the application. The following information are given for each tabs.
  
  ==> *HMW-3* 
       --> In this tab, user can make equalization and streach through different images.
 
  ==> *Histogram* 
       --> In this tab, user can see histogram graph of the original image and image processed image. This graphs are made automatically after aby image process algorithm worked by user.
       
  ==> *HMW-4.1* 
       --> In this tab, user can apply Minimum Filter, Maximum Filter, Median Filter, and Average Filter. User needs to enter row and column values to implement these filters.
       
  ==> *HMW-4.2* 
       --> In this tab, user can make Laplacian Filter, Sobel Filter, Sobel Smooth Filter, Sharpened Image Filter, Mask Image Filter, and Image+Mask Filter. 
       --> This tab is directly made to clean skeleton image. User can try this image by following steps.
            1-) Laplacian Filter
            2-) Sharpened Image Filter
            3-) Sobel Filter
            4-) Sobel Smooth Filter
            5-) Mask Image Filter
            6-) Image+Mask Filter
            
  ==> *HMW-5.1*       
       --> In this tab, user can apply High Pass Filter and Thresholding.

  ==> *HMW-5.2*       
       --> In this tab, user can apply Moire Pattern.
       
  ==> *HMW-6*       
       --> In this tab, user can apply different noises and different filters to observe noise and filters.
       --> User can use Salt Noise, Pepper Noise, Salt&Pepper Noise, Periodic Noise, Gaussian Noise, and Blur Image.
       --> User can use Median Filter, Maximum Filter, Minimum Filter, Average Filter, Weiner Filter, Adaptive Local Filter, and Notch Filter.
       
  ==> *HMW-8*       
       --> In this tab, user can apply different properties in the image. These properties are Open Image, Close Image, Extract Gradient, Top Hat Transformation, and Textual Segmentation.
  
  ==> *HMW-9*       
       --> In this tab, user can apply OTSU Method, Region Growing, and Coordinate selection.
